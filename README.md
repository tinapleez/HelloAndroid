Instructions from Udacity Android Basics Lesson 5 to create a project using, at a minimum, elements learned from Lessons 1 and 2. I added some other elements that were suggested in the Udacity Forum such as using the strings.xml file, and I learned how to link text. Then I looked up how to use the Git integration in Android Studio. I looks like a put a note in where it didn't belong because it is showing up next to all the files.
